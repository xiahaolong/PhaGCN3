1. Open `final_prediction.csv` with Notepad++ and replace the "_like" characters with an empty string to remove them. Then, open `final_prediction.csv` in Excel, copy columns A and D-J into a new Excel sheet, and save it as `final_prediction_1.csv`.
2. Run the script `phagcn3deal_1.py` to generate the file `fina_prediction_1_out.csv`: `python phagcn3deal_1.py`.
3. Open `processed_test_nodes_taxonomy.tsv` with Notepad++, use a regular expression to replace all semicolons (`;`) and tab characters (`\t`) with commas (`,`), then change the file extension from `.tsv` to `.csv`. Open it in Excel, remove the rows that are predicted as the "Viruses" category, and then copy the sequence names in the `seq_name` column and their corresponding lineage classification into the `fina_prediction_1_out.csv` file.
4. Open `final_prediction.csv` in Excel, copy the contents of columns A, B, and C (contig_name, prediction, prediction_score) into a new Excel sheet, and save it as `score.csv`. To adjust the `processed_test_nodes_taxonomy.csv` file for easier score statistics, run `python dealgenomad.py processed_test_nodes_taxonomy.csv processed_test_nodes_taxonomy_output.csv`. Open `processed_test_nodes_taxonomy_output.csv` in Excel, and copy the contents of columns A, B, and C from row 2 onward into the `score.csv` file.
5. Run `python phagcn3deal_2.py` to generate `ICTVTaxoChallenge.csv`.
